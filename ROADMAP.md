# Roadmap

## MVP (current)
- SwiftUI app scaffold with local storage via in-memory repository (Core Data to be plugged in later).
- Library list, Add (+), Recipe detail, Edit.
- Paste URL and best-effort parse (stubs in ParsingService).
- Import CSV/JSON. Export Text/Markdown.
- Basic search and filters (tags/cuisine, creator, favorites).

## Next (v1.1)
- CloudKit sync.
- Share Extension (save from Safari/YouTube app).
- Robust web parsing and improved error handling.
- App icon and visual polish.

## Later
- iPad-specific layouts and keyboard shortcuts.
- Web companion or cross-platform sync backend.
